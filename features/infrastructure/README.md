# Infrastructure

**DoDs:** see [`./dods.yaml`](./dods.yaml) · Gate: **confidence ≥ 100%**

## Why

Everything depends on the stack running. If services aren't healthy, nothing else works.

## What

```
make build → immutable tagged images
make up → compose stack running
make test → all services respond
```

### Components

| Component | Path | Role |
|-----------|------|------|
| Compose stack | `deploy/compose/` | Docker Compose, Makefile, env |
| Helm charts | `deploy/helm/` | Kubernetes deployment |
| Env config | `deploy/env-example` | env template with defaults |
| Deploy scripts | `deploy/scripts/` | Fresh setup automation |

## How

### 1. Build images

```bash
cd deploy/compose
make build
# Builds all images with immutable tag (e.g., 260405-1517):
#   api-gateway, admin-api, runtime-api, meeting-api,
#   agent-api, mcp, dashboard, tts-service, vexa-bot, vexa-lite
```

### 2. Start the stack

```bash
make up
# Starts all services via docker compose
# Wait for postgres to be healthy, then all services start
```

### 3. Verify services are healthy

```bash
# Gateway
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8056/health
# 200

# Admin API
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8067/users
# 200

# Runtime API
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8090/health
# 200

# Dashboard
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:3001
# 200

# Transcription service (GPU check)
curl -s http://localhost:8085/health
# {"status": "ok", "gpu_available": true}

# Redis
redis-cli ping
# PONG
```

### 4. Check database

```bash
# Verify tables exist via API
curl -s -H "X-API-Key: $VEXA_API_KEY" http://localhost:8056/bots
# 200 [...]

curl -s -H "X-API-Key: $VEXA_API_KEY" http://localhost:8056/meetings
# 200 [...]
```

### 5. Tear down

```bash
make down
```

| minio-up | MinIO is healthy / has ready replicas | 10 | ✅ pass | `compose`: smoke-health/MINIO_UP: MinIO responds — recordings and browser state storage work; `helm`: smoke-health/MINIO_UP: 1 ready replicas |
| db-schema | Database schema is aligned with the current model | 10 | ✅ pass | `lite`: smoke-health/DB_SCHEMA_ALIGNED: all required columns present; `compose`: smoke-health/DB_SCHEMA_ALIGNED: all required columns present; `helm`: smoke-health/DB_SCHEMA_ALIGNED: all required columns present |
| gateway-timeout | Gateway proxy timeout is ≥30s (prevents premature 504s under load) | 10 | ✅ pass | `lite`: smoke-static/GATEWAY_TIMEOUT_ADEQUATE: API gateway HTTP client timeout >= 15s — browser session creation needs time; `compose`: smoke-static/GATEWAY_TIMEOUT_ADEQUATE: API gateway HTTP client timeout >= 15s — browser session creation needs time; `helm`: smoke-static/GATEWAY_TIMEOUT_ADEQUAT… |

| chart-security-hardened | global.securityContext sets allowPrivilegeEscalation: false and drops ALL capabilities | 10 | ✅ pass | `helm`: smoke-static/HELM_GLOBAL_SECURITY_HARDENED: global.securityContext blocks privilege escalation and drops all Linux capabilities — pods run with minimum required privileges |
| chart-redis-tuned | redis deployment args include --maxmemory and an eviction policy | 10 | ✅ pass | `helm`: smoke-static/HELM_REDIS_MAXMEMORY_SET: redis deployment is capped at a specific maxmemory with an eviction policy — no unbounded growth |
