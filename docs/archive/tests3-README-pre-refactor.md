# tests3 — Fail-fast test system

## Why

Vexa has multiple services, three deployment modes, and an end-to-end chain from browser automation to transcription scoring. A misconfigured env var silently breaks login. A regression in a redirect ships unnoticed. A healthy service doesn't mean the API contract is intact.

Every known bug should become a permanent lock. Every deployment should prove itself healthy. Failures should stop the chain immediately -- not after ten minutes of cascading timeouts.

## What

Two complementary strategies in one Makefile.

**Checks** are registry-driven. Each check is a JSON entry in `checks/registry.json` — a documented regression lock with a tier, a symptom, and a concrete assertion. The runner filters by tier and executes. Adding a check means adding one JSON object. No test files, no boilerplate.

**Tests** are script-driven. Each script orchestrates a real workflow: create a meeting via CDP, launch a bot, send TTS audio, fetch and score the transcript. Scripts read and write state via `.state/` files, which decouples stages so any step can be rerun independently or paused for human intervention.

Both strategies share a **tiered fail-fast pipeline**:

```
static  -->  env  -->  health  -->  contract  -->  meeting  -->  bot  -->  transcribe
  0s          2s        5s           15s            60s          5min        2min
 grep      docker     curl       curl+auth        CDP          poll      TTS+score
           exec
```

Each tier gates the next. If services are down, there's no point testing API contracts. If API contracts are broken, there's no point launching a bot. Failures isolate the root cause to a specific layer.

**Cross-deployment abstraction** makes the same checks work on compose, lite (single container), and helm. The only moving part: `svc_exec` routes container commands to `docker exec`, single-container exec, or `kubectl exec` depending on deployment mode.

## Workflow

Work locally. Deploy-test last.

```
1. Code change
   └─→ make -C tests3 locks          <1s    catch regressions before anything else

2. After restart / deploy
   └─→ make -C tests3 smoke          30s    env + health + contracts

3. Feature validation
   └─→ make -C tests3 dashboard      30s    login, proxy, pagination
   └─→ make -C tests3 containers     2min   bot lifecycle
   └─→ make -C tests3 webhooks       15s    envelope, HMAC
   └─→ make -C tests3 meeting-tts    10min  live GMeet + TTS + transcript (human admits)
   └─→ TEAMS_MEETING_URL=... make -C tests3 meeting-tts-teams  10min  live Teams + TTS + transcript

4. Before release (final gate)
   └─→ make -C tests3 vm-compose     6min   fresh VM, pull :dev, full smoke
   └─→ make -C tests3 vm-lite        5min   fresh VM, pull lite:dev, smoke
   └─→ make -C tests3 vm-destroy            tear down
```

Steps 1-3 are local, fast, iterative. Step 4 runs once when everything else is green. Don't iterate on VMs — debug locally, verify remotely.

## How

### Quick start

```bash
make -C tests3 smoke         # 40 checks, ~30s, no meetings
make -C tests3 meeting-tts   # smoke + live meeting + TTS + transcript, ~10min
make -C tests3 locks         # just static regression locks, <1s
make -C tests3 clean         # clear state from previous runs
make -C tests3 help          # list all targets
```

### Adding a regression lock

When you fix a bug, lock it:

1. Fix the code
2. Add one entry to `checks/registry.json` with the right tier
3. Run `make -C tests3 locks` to verify it passes

That's it. The check runs automatically on every `make smoke`.

### Targets

#### Checks (registry-driven, instant)

| Target      | Tier     | What it checks                            | Needs                 |

| ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `clean` | Clear `.state/` from previous runs |
| `help`  | List all targets                   |

### Deployment testing

Each deployment mode (compose, lite, helm) gets validated against the same test suite on fresh infrastructure.

#### How it works

1. **Provision** -- `make vm-compose` or `make vm-lite` spins up a Linode VM (Ubuntu 24.04, g6-standard-6)
2. **Deploy** -- setup script installs Docker, clones the repo, deploys the target mode:
   - **compose**: `make all` in `deploy/compose/` -- multi-container stack (gateway, admin-api, dashboard, runtime, transcription, Redis, MinIO, Postgres)
   - **lite**: single `vexa` container + external Postgres -- `Dockerfile.lite` bundles all services into one image via supervisord
3. **Smoke** -- runs the same `make smoke` checks against the deployed target, plus mode-specific integration tests
4. **Tear down** -- `make vm-destroy` deletes the VM and clears state

```
local machine                          Linode VM
─────────────                          ─────────
make vm-compose ──provision──→  fresh Ubuntu 24.04
                ──scp tests3──→  /root/vexa/tests3/
                ──ssh setup──→   docker compose up
                ──ssh smoke──→   make -C tests3 smoke DEPLOY_MODE=compose
                               ← stream results back
make vm-destroy ──delete──→     gone
```

State files (`.state/vm_ip`, `.state/vm_id`, `.state/vm_mode`) track the active VM so `vm-ssh`, `vm-destroy`, and test runs know where to connect.

#### What each mode validates

| Mode    | Setup time | Services                                      | Tests run on VM                                        |
| ------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| compose | ~6 min     | Multi-container (one per service)              | smoke, dashboard-auth, dashboard-proxy, containers, webhooks |
| lite    | ~5 min     | Single container + external Postgres           | smoke, dashboard-auth, containers                      |
| helm    | 0 (cluster exists) | K8s cluster (staging)            | smoke + K8s checks, dashboard, containers, full        |

#### Why fresh VMs

Local Docker caches images, configs, and volumes. A test that passes locally might fail on a clean deploy because of a missing env var default or an image layer that wasn't rebuilt. Fresh VMs catch what local runs miss.

### Cross-deployment usage

```bash
# Local compose (auto-detected)
make -C tests3 smoke

# Lite on a VM
make -C tests3 smoke DEPLOY_MODE=lite

# Helm on staging
make -C tests3 smoke DEPLOY_MODE=helm \
  GATEWAY_URL=https://api.staging.vexa.ai \
  DASHBOARD_URL=https://app.staging.vexa.ai
```

`svc_exec` routes container commands:

| Mode    | `svc_exec dashboard printenv X` becomes       |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| compose | `docker exec vexa-dashboard-1 printenv X`                   |
| lite    | `docker exec vexa printenv X`                               |
| helm    | `kubectl exec deploy/{release}-vexa-dashboard -- printenv X` |

### Registry format

Every check is a JSON entry in `checks/registry.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "LOGIN_REDIRECT",
  "tier": "static",
  "found": "2026-04-07",
  "symptom": "After login, user redirected to /agent instead of /meetings",
  "file": "services/dashboard/src/app/login/page.tsx",
  "must_match": "push(\"/\")",
  "must_not_match": "push\\(\"/agent\"\\)"
}
```

#### Tier-specific fields

**static** -- grep source files:

- `file`: path relative to repo root
- `must_match`: literal substring that must be present
- `must_not_match`: regex pattern that must NOT be present

**env** -- compare env vars across containers:

- `env_checks[].service`: container to exec into
- `env_checks[].var`: env var name
- `env_checks[].not_empty`: must have a value
- `env_checks[].equals`: `{service, var}` -- must match another container's var
- `env_checks[].valid_against`: `{url, header}` -- use the value as a credential

**health** -- curl endpoints:

- `url`: endpoint (supports `$GATEWAY_URL`, `$ADMIN_URL`, `$DASHBOARD_URL`)
- `expect_code`: HTTP status (int or list)
- `needs_admin_token`: bootstrap token from container env

**contract** -- test API behavior:

- `url`, `method`, `data`, `auth` (`api_token` or `admin_token`), `expect_code`
- `method: WS_PING` for WebSocket checks

## Coverage

## Relationship to tests2

tests2 is agent-interpreted markdown procs. tests3 is executable code.

- tests2 procs are useful for **discovery** -- debugging, finding new bugs, evaluating transcription quality
- tests3 checks are useful for **enforcement** -- preventing known bugs from returning, validating deployments

The workflow: agent runs tests2 procs, finds a bug, fixes code, adds a tests3 registry entry. The bug never comes back.

|          | tests2                         | tests3                |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Format   | Markdown procs                 | Shell/Python scripts  |
| Runs via | Agent interprets               | `make` targets        |
| Speed    | Minutes-hours                  | Seconds-minutes       |
| Purpose  | Discovery, deep validation     | Regression prevention |
| When     | Before release, debug sessions | Every code change, CI |

## Data collection

### Why collect

Regression checks validate that the system works. Data collection measures **how well** it works -- speaker attribution accuracy, word error rate, segment completeness. You can't improve transcription quality without ground-truth datasets to score against.

### What a collection run produces

A collection run is a live meeting where known utterances are played via TTS and the pipeline's output is captured alongside the input:

```
testdata/gmeet-compose-260405/
├── ground-truth.json          # input: [{speaker, text, delay_ms}, ...]
└── pipeline/
    ├── rest-segments.json     # what the REST API returned
    ├── db-segments.csv        # what Postgres stored
    └── score.json             # quality metrics
```

**Ground truth** = scripted utterances with speaker labels and timing. **Raw output** = what the transcription pipeline actually produced. **Score** = how closely output matched input (speaker accuracy, text similarity, completeness, hallucination count).

### How it works today

Collection currently lives in `tests/` as agent-interpreted markdown procs (`tests/rt-collection.md`):

1. Host a live meeting (GMeet or Teams)
2. Launch a recorder bot (captures audio, runs transcription)
3. Launch speaker bots (one per speaker in ground truth)
4. Send TTS utterances via `POST /bots/{platform}/{id}/speak` with timed delays
5. Wait for the transcription pipeline to process
6. Capture REST API response + Postgres export
7. Score with `rt-score.py` (WER, speaker accuracy, completeness)
8. Stop all bots, save dataset to `tests/testdata/{platform}-{mode}-{date}/`

Existing datasets:
- `tests/testdata/gmeet-compose-260405/` -- 9 utterances, 3 speakers, 92% text similarity, 100% speaker accuracy
- `tests/testdata/teams-compose-260405/` -- 21 utterances, more complex multi-speaker

### What tests3 already has

`tests3/tests/transcribe.sh` runs a minimal collection: 3 TTS utterances, fetch transcript, count segments, check for ground-truth phrases. It proves the pipeline works but doesn't save datasets or compute quality metrics.

### What needs to migrate

The full collection workflow should move from agent-interpreted procs to executable scripts in tests3:

| Capability                     | Current home           | Target                         |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Multi-speaker TTS orchestration | `tests/rt-collection.md` | `tests3/tests/collect.sh`      |
| Ground-truth conversation files | `tests/testdata/*.json`  | `tests3/testdata/`             |
| Pipeline capture (REST + DB)    | `tests/rt-collection.md` | `tests3/tests/collect.sh`      |
| Offline scoring                 | `tests/rt-replay.md`    | `tests3/tests/score.sh`        |
| WS/REST consistency             | `tests/rt-delivery.md`  | `tests3/tests/delivery.sh`     |
| Dataset corpus                  | `tests/testdata/`        | `tests3/testdata/`             |

The goal: `make -C tests3 collect` runs a full collection session and saves a scored dataset. `make -C tests3 score DATASET=gmeet-compose-260405` re-scores an existing dataset offline. No agent interpretation required.
